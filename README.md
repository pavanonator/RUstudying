Using the Rutgers Schedule Of Classes API, I was able to determine when each room in every building on every campus, does not have a class in session.  
this is helpful for people who want to find an empty classroom to study in large groups or when there is lack of room in libraries.  
the front end is still in the works as far as the "web"app is concerned, but the primary challenge of data mining has been accomplished
